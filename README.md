# LENsGenres-CCIA


This repository contains the models, data, and results of the work submitted to the CCIA 2025 conference. The project focuses on the explanations generated from classifying paintings by genre using machine learning techniques.

## Repository Structure

- **DATA/**: Contains datasets used for training and testing, one dataset consist of the color frequencies of the painting and another of a set of concepts for each painting.
- **MODELS/**: Contains the tests trained in the tests.
- **TESTS/**: Includes Jupyter notebooks for evaluating models and analyzing results.
- **README.md**: Documentation for the repository.
- **LICENSE**: Licensing information for the project.

## Usage


1. Preprocess the data using the provided notebooks in the TESTS/ directory.
2. Train and evaluate models for genre classification.
3. Analyze the explanations generated by the models.
